"This tool allows you to analyze potential conflicts between trains by analyzing the timetable data to be input onto OpenTrack.

The analysis is done by identifying instances where columns D (Station Name), F (Track Number) match along with K (Departure Time) within a 5 minute buffer both before and after."
"To Use: Please insert the table data under the provided headers on the left of the 'Tool' sheet. Once ensuring the formatting requirements are met, Click 'Run Tool'. This process may take several seconds depending on the size of the dataset and/or cause excel to stop responding temporarily. This is a limitation to potential enhancements to the code due to what the analysis requires. Finally, a table should appear under the existing headers on the right of the 'Tool' sheet. This information contains (from left to right) the Train number for the first train in a given conflict, the train number for the second train, the Station the conflict occurs at, the track number the conflict takes place in, the departure time of train 1, the departure time of train 2, the row train 1's conflcit is located in within the input dataset, the row of train 2's conflict, and finally wether the conflict in question occurs 'Head On' (in Red) or in the 'same Direction' (Yellow)."
"The two red buttons labelled: 'Clear Input' and 'Clear Output' will DELETE all information on each of these tables respectively apart from the preset headers. Note that once confirmed deletion, the data cannot be recovered, a confirmation message will appear once clicking either of these buttons to prevent accidental data loss."
