Methodology

## Slide 6

Methodology

The tool is a self-contained website that uses JavaScript to process the itinerary into JSON objects. 
It then displays that data visually using SVG in the canvas tag. 
The data is visualized as grids of locations with horizontal lines for the tracks. 
The track identified in the itinerary string is made dark blue. Dashed blue lines represent guesses for locations that have * for the tracks. 
The direction of travelled is inferred from the corridor name and order of the locations.
